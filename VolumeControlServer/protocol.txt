This is the protocol:

* connect (server accepted)*
1. client greets, with a parameter to say the reason of connection.
reasons: 0 - normal client. 1 - pendingTimeConnection. (there will probably always be 0 and then if pending - connect as 1)
2. server responds with a parameter which is the client's assigned ID. (the client uses this one when connecting to the pendingTimeConnection)
3. when pending, can send 'kill all others' request, with ID specified as to which to not disconnect (self).
4.   ''  ''       ''  ''   requests to see how many left untill self's turn.
5. when it's the client's turn, can send these requests:
    Disconnect.
    GetVolume
    SetVolume, with param going from 0 to 100
    GetMute
    SetMute, with param bool.
    ToggleMute. (no param)
